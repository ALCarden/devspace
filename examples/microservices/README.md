# Microservices example

This example shows you how to develop two microservices in a single repo. The example consists of a small node webserver that makes a http request to a php webserver to retrieve some data.

# Step 0: Prerequisites

In order to use this example, make sure you have docker installed and a docker registry where you can push to (hub.docker.com, gcr.io etc.). Make sure you are logged in to the registry via `docker login`.  

Exchange the image name in `.devspace/config.yaml` under `images.php.name` and `images.node.name` with the image name you want to use. Do the same thing in `node/kube/deployment.yaml` under `spec.template.spec.image`.  Do **not** add a tag to these image names, because this will be done at runtime automatically.  

## Optional: Use self hosted cluster (minikube, GKE etc.) instead of devspace-cloud

If you want to use your own cluster instead of the devspace-cloud as deployment target, make sure `kubectl` is configured correctly to access your cluster. Then just erase the `cluster` section in the `.devspace/config.yaml` and devspace will use your current `kubectl` context as deployment target.

# Step 1: Start the devspace

To deploy the application simply run `devspace up`. The output of the command should look similar to this: 

```

```

The command built two docker images: One docker image for the node application in `node/Dockerfile` and one for the php application in `php/Dockerfile`. Then the images were pushed to the docker registry. Afterwards, the deployment.yaml in `node/kube/deployment.yaml` was deployed with kubectl and the chart in `php/chart` was deployed via helm.  

Furthermore a bi-directional sync was started between the local folder `/go-workspace/src/github.com/covexo/devspace/examples/microservices/node` and the `/app` folder within the node container. Also the folder `/go-workspace/src/github.com/covexo/devspace/examples/microservices/php` and the `/var/www/html` are synchronized. Whenever you change a file in either of those folders the change will be synchronized. In addition the node container port 3000 was forwarded to your local port 3000.  

# Step 2: Start developing

A terminal to the node container should been automatically opened. You can start the server now with `npm start` in the open terminal. Now navigate in your browser to `localhost:3000` and you should see the output 'PHP say's Hello World!'. The node server just did a request to the php server in the background.  

Now try to change the `php/index.php` and alter the message. Simply refresh your browser and your changes should be visible!  

You can also change something in `node/index.js` locally and you should see something like this: 

```
[nodemon] 1.18.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Example app listening on port 3000!
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Example app listening on port 3000!
```

Now just refresh your browser and you should see the changes immediately.
