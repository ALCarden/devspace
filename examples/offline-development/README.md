# Offline-Development example

This example shows you how to develop offline with a minikube setup. You have to run `devspace up` once while online to setup the environment correctly in your minikube cluster, but you can afterwards develop offline.

# Step 0: Prerequisites

In order to use this example, make sure you have a working minikube setup (you don't need an additional docker daemon, because devspace can use the internal minikube docker daemon). See [install minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) for more details.

# Step 1: Start DevSpace

This step has to be done once while being online. To deploy the application to minikube simply run `devspace up`. The output of the command should look similar to this: 

```

[DONE] √ Internal registry started

```

The command deployed a tiller server, internal registry and used the minikube docker daemon to build the dockerfile.  

Furthermore a bi-directional sync was started between the local folder `/go-workspace/src/github.com/covexo/devspace/examples/offline-development` and `/app` within the docker container. Whenever you change a file in either of those two folders the change will be synchronized. In addition the container port 3000 was forwarded to your local port 3000.  

# Step 2: Start developing

You can start the server now with `npm start` in the open terminal. Now navigate in your browser to `localhost:3000` and you should see the output 'Hello World!'.  

Change something in `index.js` locally and you should see something like this: 

```
[nodemon] 1.18.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Example app listening on port 3000!
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Example app listening on port 3000!
```

Now just refresh your browser and you should see the changes immediately. 

You can also exit the terminal and reopen it with `devspace up` without the need of an internet connection.
